## AI Weather App will take in the user's location and display the weather data in a user-friendly format.

#### Original AI Prompt:
Create a beginner-friendly JavaScript function code for a weather app that will take input from the form and display the current weather. The function should be able to fetch the latitude and longitude coordinates from the API from Open-Meteo API (using the current version) using the city from the input and then convert them to list the city and weather. The code should include comments to understand what is being done and why. Code should also have error handling, be readable, and follow JavaScript best practices.

#### Refined AI prompt:
Refined Prompt Using TRACI:
- Task: Write JavaScript code for a weather app function
- Role: Assume you are an experienced developer teaching a beginner
- Action: Generate a function that takes a city name from a form input, fetches coordinates from the Open-Meteo Geocoding API, and retrieves current weather data
- Context: This code will be used in a browser environment with a basic HTML form
- Intent: Help a beginner understand JavaScript by providing well-commented, readable code that follows best practices and includes error handling

#### Final Refined Prompt:
##### You are an experienced JavaScript developer helping a beginner.
**Write a clear and beginner-friendly JavaScript function that works in a browser. It should:**
- Take a city name from a form input
- Use the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to fetch latitude and longitude
- Use those coordinates to fetch current weather data
- Display the city name, temperature, and a weather description

**Please include:**
- Descriptive comments to explain each step
- Proper error handling for invalid input, network issues, and API errors

#### This refined prompt is:

- Targeted: Specifies the audience (a beginner) and the use case (in the browser)
- Clear: Lays out the inputs, outputs, and structure expected
- Contextual: Notes that itâ€™s triggered via form submission and used with HTML
- Instructional: Emphasizes that this is a learning tool, so code readability and comments are essential_



#### Recreate AI refined prompt in my words:
Refined prompt that was a little clearer and instructional: Write a function as an experienced JavaScript developer helping a beginner. The JavaScript function should be clear and beginner-friendly, and it should work in a browser. It should: take a city name from the input form, use the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to fetch latitude and longitude, use those coordinates to fetch the current weather data, and display the city name, temperature, and a weather description. Please also include descriptive comments to explain each step, proper error handling for invalid input, network issues, and API errors, and readable code that follows JavaScript best practices. Assume this function will be called when a form is submitted on a simple HTML page.
